# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## Estimates

Regarding the **estimates** that you did for practical tasks...

### How was your estimate accuracy usually?

I found that my estimates were generally close, but not always accurate. I tended to 
overestimate the time required for some tasks that I was familiar with, and underestimate 
tasks involving new concepts or tools that I had less experience with.

### How did your estimate accuracy improve or change during the course of the subject?

Over time, I became more realistic with my estimates as I gained a better understanding
of how long tasks actually take. I learned to account for debugging time and the learning
curve when new topics or libraries were introduced.

### What did you learn from doing these estimates?

I learned that estimates are not always perfect, and it's important to remain flexible.
Some tasks take longer than expected, especially when learning new concepts, and some tasks 
are quicker than anticipated once I got into a rhythm.

## Code Reviews

### What have you learned from being reviewed by other people?

Being reviewed by others helped me understand different perspectives on my code. 
I learned to value constructive criticism and realized the importance of clarity, efficiency, 
and following best practices in my coding style. It also made me aware of potential pitfalls and how to avoid them.

### What have you learned from doing code reviews of other people?

When reviewing other people's code, I developed a better eye for spotting errors or improvements in code structure.
I also learned how to give constructive feedback and explain why certain coding practices or solutions are better than 
others, which helped me solidify my own understanding of the material.

Provide proper Markdown links (not bare URLs) to two (2) PRs that show you doing good code reviews for any of the past
pracs.  
For each one, write a short explanation of what was good about your review.

### Good Code Review 1

https://github.com/Kiran12750/cp1404practicals/pull/1

### Explanation

In this code review, I focused on providing detailed feedback about code organization, variable naming conventions, 
and suggested improvements in logic. I also pointed out potential edge cases that the original code didn’t account 
for and offered solutions for handling them

### Good Code Review 2

https://github.com/Kiran12750/cp1404practicals/pull/2

### Explanation

This review was aimed at improving the readability of the code. I commented on the importance of adding comments and 
docstrings, especially for functions and complex logic. I also pointed out some redundant code and suggested more efficient
ways to accomplish the same task.

## Practicals

### Regarding the **practical tasks** overall, what would you change if you were in charge of the subject?

If I were in charge, I would include more interactive examples or tutorials in the practical tasks to help students who may
struggle with understanding certain concepts. I’d also ensure there is clearer guidance on how to debug complex code, as many
students (including myself) struggled with debugging in some of the practicals.

### What did you do really well for practicals in this subject?

I was diligent about completing the practical tasks on time and always sought to improve my understanding of the concepts by
applying them to my own mini-projects. I also took the time to review my peers' code and provide meaningful feedback, which 
helped me reinforce my own learning.
